## *The Game:*

- the game will start and the up coming tetromino [shapes in the game] will appear in the mini display to the right of the game play area 
    - Once there is a full row at the bottom of the grid then 10 points will be added each time
    - the user can start or pause the game at anytime
    - ⬆️ rotates the tetromino
    - ⬅️ moves the tetromino to the left 
    - ➡️ moves the tetromino to the right 
    - ⬇️ moves the tetromino faster down the screen
    - the user will be informed when the game is over when the tetrominoes reach the original default position
        - the word 'end' will appear where the score number is
